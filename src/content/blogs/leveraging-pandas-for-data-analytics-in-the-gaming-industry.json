        "Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python, created by Wes McKinney in 2008 to simplify working with structured data. Its name is derived from “Panel Data,” a term used in econometrics, and it reflects the library’s focus on handling and analyzing data tables in a flexible and efficient way. Built on top of NumPy, Pandas introduces data structures like Series (one-dimensional arrays) and DataFrames (two-dimensional tables), which make it easy for users to organize, filter, and manipulate large datasets efficiently (McKinney, 2012).",
        "In data analytics, Pandas has become a cornerstone library for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis. With Pandas, analysts can quickly load data from various file formats (such as CSV, Excel, and SQL databases) and perform complex data operations like merging, grouping, and pivoting. Its intuitive syntax allows for simple yet powerful data wrangling, including handling missing values, filtering data based on conditions, and reshaping datasets, which can streamline the entire data preprocessing stage (McKinney, 2012)."
